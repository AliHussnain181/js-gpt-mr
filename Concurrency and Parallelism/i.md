Concurrency and parallelism are fundamental concepts in programming, especially when dealing with tasks that can run simultaneously to improve performance. Understanding these concepts can significantly enhance your ability to write efficient and responsive applications. Here's a guide for beginners, intermediate, and advanced levels focusing on JavaScript.

### Beginners

**1. Concepts:**
- **Concurrency:** The ability to run multiple tasks or processes in overlapping periods, but not necessarily simultaneously. In JavaScript, this is often achieved through asynchronous programming.
- **Parallelism:** The ability to run multiple tasks or processes simultaneously, typically on multi-core processors. JavaScript handles this with Web Workers.

**2. Key Terms:**
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Using callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle operations that take time (e.g., fetching data from an API).
- **Event Loop:** A single-threaded loop that handles asynchronous callbacks. JavaScript uses this to manage concurrency.

**3. Examples:**
- **Asynchronous Callbacks:**
    ```javascript
    console.log('Start');

    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('This runs after 2 seconds');
    }, 2000);

    console.log('End');
    ```

- **Promises:**
    ```javascript
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
    ```

- **Async/Await:**
    ```javascript
    async function fetchData() {
      try {
        let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
      }
    }
    fetchData();
    ```

### Intermediate

**1. Concepts:**
- **Event Loop in Depth:** Understanding how the event loop, call stack, task queue, and microtask queue interact.
- **Concurrency Control:** Techniques to manage and control concurrent tasks, such as throttling and debouncing.

**2. Key Tools:**
- **Web Workers:** For running scripts in background threads.
- **Service Workers:** For managing caching and background tasks in web applications.
- **Concurrency Libraries:** Libraries like `async`, `RxJS`, or `Bluebird` to manage complex asynchronous flows.

**3. Examples:**
- **Event Loop Visualization:**
    ```javascript
    console.log('Start');

    setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout'), 0);

    Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise'));

    console.log('End');
    // Output: Start, End, Promise, Timeout
    ```

- **Web Workers:**
    ```javascript
    // main.js
    const worker = new Worker('worker.js');

    worker.postMessage('Hello Worker');

    worker.onmessage = function(event) {
      console.log('Received from worker:', event.data);
    };

    // worker.js
    onmessage = function(event) {
      postMessage('Hello from worker: ' + event.data);
    };
    ```

### Advanced

**1. Concepts:**
- **Parallelism in Depth:** Leveraging multi-core processors for parallel execution.
- **Advanced Concurrency Patterns:** Patterns like producer-consumer, fork-join, and pipelining.
- **Non-blocking I/O:** Techniques to handle I/O operations without blocking the main thread.

**2. Key Tools:**
- **Cluster Module:** For creating child processes to handle multiple requests.
- **Node.js Streams:** For processing data piece-by-piece, especially useful for large data sets.
- **Concurrency Libraries:** Advanced usage of libraries like `async`, `RxJS`, or `Bluebird` for complex flows.

**3. Examples:**
- **Cluster Module:**
    ```javascript
    const cluster = require('cluster');
    const http = require('http');
    const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

    if (cluster.isMaster) {
      for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
        cluster.fork();
      }

      cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
        console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
      });
    } else {
      http.createServer((req, res) => {
        res.writeHead(200);
        res.end('Hello World\n');
      }).listen(8000);
    }
    ```

- **Node.js Streams:**
    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs');
    const readStream = fs.createReadStream('largeFile.txt');
    const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

    readStream.pipe(writeStream);

    readStream.on('data', chunk => {
      console.log('Received chunk:', chunk.length);
    });

    readStream.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Read stream ended');
    });
    ```
